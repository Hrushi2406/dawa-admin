        "description": "Gaviscon Syrup provides quick and lasting relief from pain and discomfort such as heartburn and indigestion.

        "description": "Pan D capsule is an anti-reflux medicine used to treat GERD or gastroesophageal reflux disease. It contains pantoprazole and domperidone as active ingredients. The combination is used in patients in which pantoprazole alone cannot control acid reflux. Pantoprazole works by inhibiting a pump called the proton pump in the stomach wall, which is responsible for the secretion of stomach acids for digestion and leads to reduced acid production. Domperidone stops vomiting. It increases the movement in the stomach and bowel so that acid does not flow back into the food pipe.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux disease is a condition where acid from the stomach flows back to the food pipe. The backflow of acid irritates the lining of the food pipe and leads to chest pain and heartburn.\n\nPantop Dsr, Pantosec Dsr, Pantakind Dsr and Pantodac Dsr are a few more tablets that also include pantoprazole and domperidone. Pan D must be taken as directed by the doctor and in doses and duration as prescribed. It must be taken before meals. Do not miss any dose or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n\nAlong with taking medicine on time, certain lifestyle modifications can help manage your acidity problem better. Try eating smaller meals, eating slowly, avoiding overeating, and lying down immediately after having a meal. Limit your intake of alcohol, avoid smoking, and maintain a healthy weight. Consult the doctor to understand what works best for you.",

Some other capsules containing rabeprazole and domperidone are Rablet D capsule, Rabekind DSR capsule, Rabesec DSR capsule, and Rabium DSR capsule.\n\nGastrointestinal reflux disease or GERD, is a condition in which acid from the stomach flows back to the food pipe and causes heartburn, belching, nausea and chest pain. It works by reducing the amount of acid produced in the stomach and improves the motility in the gut, thus, reducing the backflow of stomach content into the food pipe.\n\nRazo-D capsule should be taken as directed by the doctor and in doses and duration as prescribed. Do not miss any dose or take it more often than your doctor prescribes.\n\nAlong with taking medicine on time, making certain lifestyle modifications can help to manage your acidity problem better. Try eating smaller meals, eating slowly and avoiding overeating and lying down immediately after having a meal. Limit your intake of alcohol, avoid smoking and maintain a healthy weight, consult the doctor to understand what works for you best.\n\nInform your doctor if you are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breastfeeding and about all the medicines and supplements you take and all the conditions or diseases you suffer from before starting this medicine.",

        "description": "Rabekind DSR is a combination medicine containing rabeprazole and domperidone, and it is used to treat acid reflux disease. It works by alleviating acid-related symptoms like heartburn, stomach pain, and irritation. It also neutralises acid and improves gas flow, hence reducing stomach discomfort.\n\nGERD is a condition in which acid from the stomach comes back up to the food pipe and causes heartburn, belching, nausea and chest pain. Rabekind-DSR works by decreasing the amount of acid produced in the stomach. Thereby improving the mortality in the gut and reducing the backflow of stomach content to the food pipe.\n\nAlong with taking medicine on time, making certain lifestyle modifications can help to manage your acidity problem better. Try eating smaller meals, eating slowly avoiding overeating and lying down immediately after having a meal. Limit your intake of alcohol, avoid smoking and maintain a healthy weight. Consult the doctor to understand what works best for you. Some other capsules containing rabeprazole and domperidone are Razo D capsule, Cyra D capsule, Rabesec DSR capsule, and Rabium DSR capsule.\n\nTake Rabekind DSR at least 30 minutes before breakfast. This capsule should not be used in children below 12 years of age. Before using the Rabekind DSR capsule, inform the doctor if you are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breastfeeding and about your detailed medical history.",
